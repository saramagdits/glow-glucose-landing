What Apple Means by “Support URL”
The Support URL is not just your marketing landing page.
Apple expects this to be a place where users can:
Contact you for help
Get answers to common questions
Troubleshoot issues
Understand how to use the app
If someone downloads Glow Glucose and something breaks, this is the link they’ll tap from the App Store listing.
So technically, yes — you can put https://glowglucose.com…
But it’s not best practice.
What You Should Do Instead (Best Practice)
Create:
https://glowglucose.com/support
Even a simple page is fine. It does not need to be elaborate.
What a Support Page Should Include (Minimum Viable Version)
Here’s a clean, Apple-friendly structure:
1. Contact Section
A support email (e.g., support@glowglucose.com)
Optional: contact form
2. Basic FAQ
Examples:
How do I log a meal?
How does AI meal analysis work?
How do I log blood glucose?
Is my data private?
How do I delete my account?
3. Privacy & Data Help
Especially important since you're:
Logging health data
Handling blood sugar values
Using AI analysis
Apple takes health apps seriously.
4. Response Expectation
Example:
We respond within 48 hours.
That tiny sentence makes you look professional and legitimate.
Why You Shouldn’t Just Use the Landing Page
Your homepage is for:
Marketing
Explaining what Glow Glucose is
Encouraging downloads
Support is for:
Solving problems
Building trust
Passing App Review smoothly
Apple reviewers do click that link.
Extra Tip (Health App Specific)
Since Glow Glucose tracks gestational diabetes:
Make sure the support page:
Does not give medical advice
Encourages users to consult their provider
Clarifies the app is not a medical device (if applicable)
That protects you.
What Most Indie Apps Do
Most solo founders:
Create a simple /support page
Add a support email
Add 5–10 FAQs
Call it done
It does not need Zendesk or anything fancy.
