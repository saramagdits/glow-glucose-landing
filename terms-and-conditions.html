                        <p class="legal-important"><strong>IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.</strong></p>

                        <h3>4.1 Not Medical Advice</h3>
                        <p>The Glow Glucose App is designed to help you track meals, nutritional information, and blood glucose readings for gestational diabetes management. However, the App is NOT intended to provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</p>

                        <h3>4.2 Consult Your Healthcare Provider</h3>
                        <p>Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider, such as your doctor, endocrinologist, registered dietitian, or certified diabetes educator, before making any decisions about your health or diabetes management. Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of information provided by the App.</p>

                        <h3>4.3 No Doctor-Patient Relationship</h3>
                        <p>Use of the App does not create a doctor-patient relationship between you and Glow Glucose or any of its employees, contractors, or affiliates.</p>

                        <h3>4.4 Accuracy of Information</h3>
                        <p>While we strive to provide accurate nutritional information through our AI-powered food analysis, this information should be used as a general guide only. Nutritional content may vary based on preparation methods, portion sizes, and other factors. Always verify nutritional information with your healthcare team when making dietary decisions related to gestational diabetes.</p>

                        <h3>4.5 Emergency Situations</h3>
                        <p>The App is not designed for emergency situations. If you experience a medical emergency, including but not limited to severe hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, call emergency services (911 in the United States) or go to the nearest emergency room immediately.</p>

                        <h3>4.6 Individual Health Needs</h3>
                        <p>Gestational diabetes management varies from person to person. The App provides general tracking tools but cannot account for your individual health needs, medications, or conditions. Your healthcare provider should always be your primary source for personalized medical guidance.</p>
